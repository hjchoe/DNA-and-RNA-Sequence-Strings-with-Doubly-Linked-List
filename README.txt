This lab serves as a basic DNA/RNA sequence manipulation tool.
It utilizes a doubly linked list and can be invoked from the command line by providing the size of the array of DNA sequences and the command file containing the commands to be executed on the sequences.
These commands include ‘insert’ which inserts the sequence at a specific position, ‘remove’, which removes a sequence at a specific position, ‘print’ which allows you to print all the sequences in the sequenceArray and print at a specific position, ‘clip’ which removes a subsequence from a sequence, ‘copy’ which copies the sequence in one position to another, and ‘transcribe’, which converts a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence.
The program checks for logical errors like out-of-bounds array or sequence access and provides debugging.
The output of the program is written to standard output and then it terminates after reading the end-of-file mark.
